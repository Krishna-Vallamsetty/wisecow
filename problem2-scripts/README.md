# Problem 2: DevOps Scripts in Python

This repository contains Python script solutions for the second problem statement of the AccuKnox DevOps Trainee assessment. I have chosen to implement Objective 1 (System Health Monitoring) and Objective 4 (Application Health Checker).

'''
## 1. System Health Monitoring Script (`health_monitor.py`) üñ•Ô∏è

This script monitors the health of the local system by checking key resources: **CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space**.  
It logs the status to both the console and a persistent file (`system_health.log`). If any resource exceeds a predefined threshold, it will raise a clear alert.

### Setup and Execution (System Health Monitoring)

```bash
# Install the required psutil library
pip install psutil

# Execute the script
python health_monitor.py

# Example Output (Normal Conditions)
2025-09-20 17:30:00,123 - INFO - --- Starting System Health Check ---
2025-09-20 17:30:01,234 - INFO - CPU usage is normal: 15.4%
2025-09-20 17:30:01,235 - INFO - Memory usage is normal: 45.8%
2025-09-20 17:30:01,236 - INFO - Disk space is normal: 25.2% used

------------------
## 2. **Application Health Checker** (`app_health_checker.py`) üåê

This script acts as an external uptime monitor.  
It checks the health of a list of predefined web applications by making HTTP requests and verifying status codes.

### Setup and Execution (Application Health Checker)

```bash
# Install the required requests library
pip install requests

# Execute the script
python app_health_checker.py

# Example Output
2025-09-20 17:22:44,723 - INFO - --- Starting Application Health Checks ---
